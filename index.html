<!--
The first section here includes the actual content of each of the sections
content can be written using proto-markdown which supports:

Headings up to h3 using a number of # symbols followed by a space and ending in a new line
Italics can be inserted by surrounding text in _ underscores
Bold can be inserted by surrounding text in * asterisks
Links can be inserted by using the link text in square brackets followed by the address in parentheses, e.g. [click here](www.ljmu.ac.uk)

There are also various built-in shortcuts:
\dateto will print the date when that section needs to be done by
\datefrom will print the date when that section needs to be started
\numdays will print the total number of days between these dates
\section will print the current section, e.g. planning
\Section will print the current section with a capital e.g. Planning
\module will print the module id number from the url
\p will start a new paragraph

We can also print content for specific course modules by using the syntax ~(moduleid){content}, this module id is the id used in the url and is the same that will be printed with \module

You can also define your own shortcuts by using a <div class="shortcut"></div>, see below for an example
-->

<div id="planningcontent" class="content">
  \toplines
  ## Introduction
  Here we can insert details introducing the Planning phase
  ### Links
  And then we can _insert_ [links](https://ljmu.ac.uk). Make sure you use my *proto-markdown* style formatting!
  ## Where are we?
  We are currently in the \faculty canvas course.
  \p
  ~(FET){
  This is the FET Faculty.
  \p
  So here is where we would write content for the Faculty of Engineering & Technology
  }
  ~(APSS){
  This is the APSS Faculty.
  \p
  Here, we would write content for the \Section phase of the Assignment Calculator for the Faculty of Arts, Professional and Social Studies.
  }
  ~(Health){
  This is the content for the Health faculty.
  }
  ~(Science){
  We can write separate content for each of the faculties by using the correct syntax.
  }
  ~(BL){
  Business & Law content is here.
  }

<!--
Here we have a keyboard shortcut example using a <div> tag. We define the <div> to be of class "shortcut" and provide an id, the example below uses the id"toplines" to do this. This will then replace any occurence of \toplines in our content with what is contained here, including replacing the other shortcuts. I have also wrapped this in another shortcut \plaintext to make all the tabs, apart from Planning currently the same.
-->

<div id="toplines" class="shortcut">
  # \Section
  The \section phase is expected to go from \datefrom to \dateto, giving a total of \numdays
</div>

<div id="plaintext" class="shortcut">
  \toplines
  ## Introduction
  Here we can insert details introducing the \section phase.
  ### Go Back
  Please have a look at the Planning phase for more details
